# ðŸ§  Numerical Methods Comparison: Newton-Raphson vs Bisection

This project compares the performance of two numerical root-finding algorithms:

- Newton-Raphson Method
- Bisection Method

Implemented in pure Python (no third-party libraries).

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `bisection.py`: Bisection root solver
- `newton.py`: Newton-Raphson root solver
- `functions.py`: Functions for testing (like x^2 - 612)
- `compare.py`: Runs both methods and compares performance
- `README.md`: This file

## ðŸ“Š Example

Solving `xÂ² - 612 = 0`:

- Newton-Raphson â†’ Root in 6 steps  
- Bisection â†’ Root in 23 steps  
âœ… Newton-Raphson is faster here

Run `compare.py` to see results.
